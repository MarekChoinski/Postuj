## Adding posts

## Posts
- [ ] add plus attribute for posts
- [ ] add possibility for adding images
- [ ] iReady profile menubar
- [ ] onHover on date post it should show exact date

## Miscellaneous
- [ ] realtime checking username
- [ ] i18n

# Profiles
- [ ] add profile page
- [ ] add role: user, mod, admin

## Done
- [X] add sorting on mainpage by date and pluses
- [X] format date on posts
- [X] place "Show post" to footer of postcard
- [X] on-auth different menubar
- [X] delete adding posts without being signed up
- [X] add avatars
- [X] Generalnie dobrym pomysłem będzie trzymanie jednak info o userze w firestore-database. Będzie można wtedy prawdopodobnie lepiej sie poruszać wokół bazy. Zatem createUser będzie musiał być usunięty.

## Notes

- [ ] Mainpage is totally obscure with this whole recursive achievieng posts and profiles. This should be custom hook or whatever. Don't say anything about this favoritePosts crap xD. Also this don't work well in PostPage. This should get some DRY rule with selectors etc.
